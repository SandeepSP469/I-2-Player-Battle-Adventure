# I-2-Player-Battle-Adventure
Both players will have one turn at a time.

Each player will have two options for performing an action.

    To heal → This will heal the active player and current health will get updated.
        If the health of the player is already full then healing will not take place and the respected player will lose the turn showing some text output.
    To attack → This will damage the other player and console-based output will get shown.
